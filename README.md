## Disney-Clone

This project is based on `React JS` in frontend and here I used movie API from `TMDB` to provide a trending movie.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173/) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/App.jsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
